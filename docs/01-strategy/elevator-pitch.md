# ðŸš€ Elevator Pitch â€“ Boutique UX Studio (Minneapolis)

> **Have you ever lost patients to confusing online booking or intake formsâ€”only to see them give up and call the front desk?**

Iâ€™m **Coriyon Arrington**, founder of \[Your Studio Name], a boutique UX design studio in Minneapolis serving small-to-medium health & wellness practicesâ€”dental offices, chiropractic clinics, therapy centers, and more.

**The problem:** Clinics waste time and revenue on generic website builders or one-size-fits-all designs, leading to no-shows and support overload.

**The solution:** We create **user-tested, clickable prototypes** and polished UX designs in days, not weeks, through three clear packages:

* **Starter Sprint:** Rapid 2-week prototype of your most critical flow.
* **Growth Kit:** Full site/app refresh with UX audit, two prototypes, and basic design system.
* **Scale Suite:** End-to-end UX partnershipâ€”research, AI prototype, testing, design system, and one month of support.

Each package includes engagement guarantees and bonus resources to ensure success.

**The benefit:** Reduce no-shows by up to 40%, free up staff time, and launch with confidenceâ€”knowing your digital tools are built around real patient needs.
