# 📌 Positioning Strategy — Growing Your Client Base Without Stepping on CareHive’s Toes – Coriyon’s Studio

---

Below are tactical positioning ideas to build your boutique UX studio’s client base while maintaining harmony with your full-time role at CareHive Health.

## 1. Distinct Niche Definition

* **Brick-and-Mortar Health & Wellness**: Focus on in-person clinics, spas, dental and chiropractic offices—not telehealth platforms.  
* **Front-End UX Partner**: Position yourself as the specialist in patient-facing interfaces (booking, intake, portals), while CareHive focuses on backend clinical workflows and data sync.

## 2. Transparent Side-Project Framing

* **After-Hours Consulting**: Emphasize that studio work occurs evenings/weekends, outside your CareHive responsibilities.  
* **HR & Legal Clarity**: Secure written acknowledgment from HR/leadership at CareHive that moonlighting is permitted—demonstrating professionalism and trust.

## 3. Complementary Services for CareHive

* **White-Label Templates**: Offer clinic portal templates that CareHive can present to its partners, adding value without competing on core telehealth features.  
* **Co-Branded Workshops**: Pitch a UX workshop for CareHive’s referral network (e.g., “Streamlining Patient Onboarding”), reinforcing your role as a supportive ally.

## 4. Future Partnership Narrative

* **Pilot-to-Partner Story**: Frame CareHive as your next venture opportunity: “After refining best practices with local clinics, my goal is to collaborate with CareHive to bring these proven UX solutions to telehealth.”  
* **Mutual Learning Asset**: Highlight how insights from clinic work can inform telehealth UX and vice versa, creating a symbiotic relationship.

## 5. Brand Language & Visual Differentiation

* **Messaging**: Avoid telehealth buzzwords (video consult, EHR integration); instead use “appointment booking,” “patient intake,” and “in-office digital kiosks.”  
* **Visuals**: Employ clinic imagery (waiting room, front-desk tablet) rather than telemedicine booths or VR headsets.
