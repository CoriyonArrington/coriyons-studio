# 💼 Coriyon’s Studio – Elevator Pitch

---

Hi, I’m Coriyon Arrington, founder of Coriyon’s Studio, a UX designer and strategist who partners with health, wellness, and tech startups to craft research-driven user experiences that accelerate growth.

When teams rely on generic templates or scattered freelance support, they often end up with inconsistent experiences and stalled momentum. Coriyon’s Studio offers rapid, insight-led sprints and AI-powered prototypes built in Next.js and Supabase for seamless handoff.

What makes us unique is our blend of deep user research, high-fidelity prototyping, and scalable design systems—delivered at startup pace. Visit **coriyonsstudio.com** to see our work and schedule your free discovery call today.
