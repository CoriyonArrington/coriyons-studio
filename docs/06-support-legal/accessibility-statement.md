# Accessibility Statement – Coriyon’s Studio

We believe digital experiences should be accessible to all. This statement outlines our commitment to inclusive design.

---

## Our Commitment

- Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for web content.  
- Provide keyboard navigability and ARIA labels.  
- Maintain high contrast and scalable text.

## Design & Development Practices

- Use semantic HTML and accessible components (Chakra UI defaults).  
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA) and contrast checkers.  
- Gather user feedback from individuals with diverse abilities.

## Continuous Improvement

We regularly audit and update our platform to improve accessibility. Please report any issues to [accessibility@coriyons.studio].
