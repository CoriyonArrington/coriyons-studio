## ✅ Key Brand Traits

| Trait               | Why It Matters                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trustworthy**     | Secure by design (HIPAA-ready), instills confidence in users.      |
| **Empathetic**      | Warm, supportive UI that feels human, not clinical.                |
| **Clear & Simple**  | Minimal friction: designs map directly to Tailwind & Chakra tokens.|
| **Scalable**        | Modular components and tokens that grow with the brand.            |
| **Accessible**      | WCAG-compliant colors, spacing, and focus states built into theme. |
