Hello! 

Here’s a quick recap of the work I completed recently:
[INSERT RECENT PR SUMMARY, e.g. “Merged `docs/refactor-guides` to unify and archive old dev/AI reference files.”]

My proposed next steps are:
1. [INSERT STEP #1, e.g. “Add a new diary‑entry form to `src/app/diary-card` using Chakra UI and existing Zod schema.”]
2. [INSERT STEP #2, e.g. “Resolve lingering ESLint errors in `src/components/button.tsx`.”]
3. [INSERT STEP #3, e.g. “Build a GraphQL endpoint for fetching user‑generated entries.”]
   (Add or remove numbered steps as needed.)

I’ve attached:
- `docs/07-reference/dev-reference.md`
- `docs/07-reference/ai-collaboration-guidelines.md`
- `docs/07-reference/ai-context-prompt.md`
- `docs/04-development/README.md`
- (Optionally: Updated directory‑tree and component‑structure JSON)

Which of these files do you need to effectively and efficiently help me tackle the next steps? 

Feel free to ask me for any additional context or clarification before proceeding. Thanks!
