# End-Chat Template

Thanks for your help! 

Please provide a summary of everything we worked on in this chat:
- What we accomplished
- If we’re still in the middle of something, where we left off
- The various approaches we tried
- What worked and what didn’t

(This will help me copy/paste this context into the next chat.)

Finally, suggest:
1. A branch name that accurately reflects the work we just did
2. A properly formatted multi‑line commit message
3. The exact git commands I need to run to push these changes to GitHub

Ensure the commit message follows our conventional format (e.g., `type(scope): short summary` with an optional body). 
Thank you!
