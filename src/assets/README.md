## üß† Font Usage Notes

* Fonts are served locally to avoid 3rd-party tracking/CDN dependencies
* Loaded via Tailwind `@font-face` declarations in `global.css`
* Optimized for performance using `font-display: swap`
* Paired intentionally to reflect calm, clear, and inclusive design

## üõ† Integrating Fonts

If modifying or adding fonts:

1. Add the `.ttf` or `.woff2` files to a dedicated subfolder
2. Add license (e.g., `OFL.txt`) to the same folder
3. Update `tailwind.config.ts` and/or `global.css`
4. Optionally update `03-design/typography.md` in `docs/`
